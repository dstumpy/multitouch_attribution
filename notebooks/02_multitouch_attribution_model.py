# # TLDR;
# We implement an algorithmic attribution approach using a machine learning model.
# The problem is seen as a classification problem where the model tries to predict
# whether a customer converts based on their customer journey or not. <br>
# With a trained model, we can measure the impact of each channel with respect to
# the conversion probability and exactly this impact is used to mirror the final
# attribution.
